While successful corporations can drive innovation and economic growth, their primary focus is often on maximizing profits, which may not align with broader societal benefits. Practices like environmental harm, labor exploitation, or monopolistic behavior can negatively impact communities and individuals.

While mothers can choose to prioritize homemaking if it aligns with their values, their first duty should not be universally defined as such. Many mothers successfully balance careers and family, and their roles should be based on personal choice and circumstances rather than societal expectations. It's important to respect diverse family dynamics and individual aspirations.","**Disagree**  

While mothers can certainly choose to prioritize homemaking if it aligns with their values, it is not inherently their ""first duty.""

Charity can be more flexible and targeted, allowing for personalized assistance to those in genuine need, whereas social security programs may sometimes lack efficiency or be subject to bureaucratic delays. However, it’s important to recognize that a combination of both systems may be ideal, as charity alone may not provide consistent or widespread support.","**Agree**  

Charity can be more flexible and targeted, allowing assistance to reach those most in need quickly and with fewer bureaucratic hurdles.

Both have merits, but charity's adaptability can sometimes address urgent needs more effectively.","**Agree**  

While charity can provide immediate and personalized assistance to those in need, social security offers a more systematic and reliable safety net. Charity often depends on the generosity of individuals or organizations, which can be inconsistent, whereas social security ensures broader coverage and long-term support for the disadvantaged.

A same-sex couple in a stable, loving relationship provides a nurturing environment for a child, just as any other committed partnership would. The ability to offer love, support, and care—not sexual orientation—should determine eligibility for adoption. Excluding loving couples based on prejudice harms both the parents and the children in need of a home.","**Strongly agree**  

A same-sex couple in a stable, loving relationship can provide a nurturing and supportive environment for a child, just as effectively as a heterosexual couple.
