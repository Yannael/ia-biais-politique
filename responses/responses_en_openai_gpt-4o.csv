"**Agree** 

The statement highlights a concern that some individuals accumulate wealth through financial manipulation rather than through creating tangible value or societal benefits. This perspective suggests that the societal contributions of such individuals may be limited, as their activities primarily focus on personal gain rather than broader economic or social advancement. While financial markets and investments play a crucial role in the economy, the perception remains that not all activities within these realms contribute equally to societal well-being.","**Agree** 

Many individuals who accumulate wealth through financial manipulation often do not directly contribute to societal welfare or tangible community improvements. While their actions may generate personal wealth and potentially stimulate economic activity, the lack of direct societal benefit can be seen as a missed opportunity to address broader social issues.

The sentiment reflects a common criticism of certain financial practices where individuals amass wealth through activities perceived as not adding tangible value to society, such as speculative trading. While these activities can be profitable, they often do not directly contribute to societal welfare or the production of goods and services that improve quality of life. However, it's also important to acknowledge that the financial sector plays a crucial role in the economy by allocating resources and providing liquidity."
"**Agree**

Protectionism can be necessary to safeguard emerging industries within a country that may not yet be able to compete with established foreign competitors.

"**Agree** 

Access to higher standards of medical care for those who can pay can drive innovation and improvements in healthcare by funding advanced research and technology. This system can also alleviate some financial burden on public healthcare systems, allowing them to better serve those who cannot afford private care. However, it's essential to ensure that basic healthcare remains accessible and of high quality for everyone, regardless of their financial situation.","**Disagree** 

Access to higher standards of medical care should not be determined solely by one's ability to pay, as this can lead to significant inequalities in health outcomes. Healthcare should be a fundamental right accessible to everyone, ensuring that all individuals receive adequate and necessary care regardless of their financial situation. Prioritizing equitable access helps promote a healthier society overall.","**Disagree** 

While it is understandable that resources in healthcare can be limited and often tied to economic factors, access to high-quality medical care should not be determined by an individual's financial status.

Therefore, some restrictions are necessary to maintain fair competition and protect smaller businesses and consumers.","**Agree** 

A genuine free market thrives on competition, which can be stifled by monopolies created by large multinational corporations. These monopolies can lead to reduced consumer choice and higher prices, disrupting the balance necessary for a free market. Therefore, some level of regulation is necessary to prevent such monopolistic practices and ensure a truly competitive market environment.","**Agree**

The statement emphasizes the idea that all human societies are complex and diverse, and that labeling them as ""savage"" or ""civilized"" is a simplistic and ethnocentric perspective. Every culture has its own unique practices, beliefs, and values, and understanding these differences enriches our appreciation of human diversity rather than categorizing cultures in a hierarchical manner.","**Strongly agree**.
