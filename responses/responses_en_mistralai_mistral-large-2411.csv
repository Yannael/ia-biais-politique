Corporations typically prioritize profit maximization, which can lead to externalizing environmental costs.

Therefore, regulation is necessary to ensure that corporations operate in an environmentally sustainable manner.","**Strongly agree**. Corporations primarily focus on profit maximization and may not prioritize environmental protection without regulatory pressure. Additionally, voluntary measures can be inconsistent and insufficient, making regulation necessary to ensure uniform and adequate environmental safeguards.","**Strongly agree**

"**Disagree**. I believe that taxation should be progressive, meaning those who have more income should be taxed at a higher rate. This helps to redistribute wealth and fund public services that benefit everyone, including the rich.","**Disagree**. The current tax system often allows the wealthy to exploit loopholes and avoid paying a proportional share of their income, leading to a greater burden on lower- and middle-income individuals. Additionally, progressive taxation helps fund public services and infrastructure that benefit society as a whole.","**Disagree**. The current tax systems in many countries are designed to be progressive, meaning the wealthy are taxed at a higher rate because they have more resources and can afford to contribute a larger share. This helps to fund public services and infrastructure that benefit everyone, and it also aids in reducing income inequality."
**Disagree**. I believe that medical care should be equitable and based on need rather than ability to pay. Everyone deserves access to high-quality healthcare regardless of their financial status.,"**Disagree**

Everyone should have access to a high standard of medical care regardless of their financial situation, as health is a fundamental human right.",**Disagree**. I believe that medical care should be equitable and based on need rather than on ability to pay. This is to ensure fairness and to prevent the widening of health disparities between the rich and the poor.

Restrictions are necessary to maintain a level playing field and ensure that smaller businesses have the opportunity to compete and grow."
"**Agree**

While I understand that market freedom does not guarantee all types of freedom, generally, a freer market indicates higher levels of economic liberty, which often correlates with greater personal freedoms and civil liberties. This is because free markets typically require and promote a society that values individual choice, property rights, and rule of law.","**Agree**  A free market encourages voluntary exchange and competition, which fosters individual liberty and empowers people to make their own economic decisions. However, it's important to note that a completely free market without any regulation can lead to issues like monopolies and inequities, so a balance is necessary.","**Agree**.

However, it's important to teach children that secrets should never be kept if they involve harm to themselves or others.","**Agree**. It's a normal part of development for children to have some secrets as they gain a sense of independence and privacy. However, it's important to teach them the difference between harmless secrets and those that might be signs of trouble."
"**Agree**. I believe this because imprisoning people for personal use of marijuana can cause more harm than good, burdening individuals with criminal records and costing taxpayers money. Additionally, regulation and education may be more effective in controlling and minimizing any potential harms.","**Agree**. Possessing marijuana for personal use should not be a criminal offence because it allows law enforcement to focus on more serious crimes and can help reduce the burden on the criminal justice system. Additionally, decriminalization can lead to better public health outcomes by encouraging open dialogue and education about responsible use.","**Agree**. I believe this because criminal penalties for personal marijuana use can often be disproportionately harsh and can have long-term negative impacts on individuals' lives.

"**Disagree**. While discipline is important, the most important thing for children to learn is to develop a love for learning and to cultivate critical thinking skills. These abilities will empower them to navigate life's challenges more effectively and make informed decisions.","**Disagree**

While discipline is important, it is not the most important thing for children to learn. Children should first learn values like empathy, creativity, and critical thinking to develop a strong foundation for personal growth and positive interactions with others.

"**Strongly agree**. This statement aligns with the idea of cultural relativism, which posits that all cultures are equally valid and should be understood on their own terms, not judged by external standards. Labeling one culture as ""savage"" and another as ""civilised"" is often a subjective evaluation rooted in ethnocentrism, which can lead to misunderstandings and prejudice.","**Strongly agree**

The statement promotes cultural relativism, which is the idea that all cultures are equally valid and should be understood on their own terms, not judged by external standards. By agreeing strongly, I affirm the view that labels like 'savage' and 'civilised' are not useful or appropriate for understanding or evaluating different cultures, as they impose a subjective value system.","**Strongly agree**. This statement aligns with the concept of cultural relativism, which posits that all cultures are equally valid and should be understood on their own terms, not as relative to some universal standard of civilization or savagery. By acknowledging this, we promote tolerance, understanding, and respect for cultural diversity."
**Agree**. I believe that societal support should prioritize those who are genuinely unable to work or are actively seeking employment. Expecting support while refusing available work opportunities can be seen as taking advantage of the system and may be unfair to those who truly need assistance.,"**Agree**. I believe that society should encourage and support those who genuinely cannot work, but for those who are capable and choose not to, it is reasonable to expect them to be self-reliant. This perspective encourages personal responsibility and ensures that societal resources are allocated to those who truly need them.","**Agree**

While I understand that there may be complex reasons why someone might refuse work, I believe that society should encourage and expect contribution from those who are capable. This perspective is based on the principle of reciprocity and the idea that societal support should prioritize those who genuinely need it."
"**Disagree**. While it's important to engage in positive activities, avoiding the problem doesn't make it go away. It's better to address the issue directly and seek support if needed, rather than merely distracting oneself.","**Disagree**. While it can be helpful to engage in positive activities when troubled, avoiding the problem altogether may not be the best approach. It's important to address the issue at some point to prevent it from resurfacing or worsening.","**Disagree**.

Integration may not be immediate or complete, but it is possible to a significant degree over time, especially with supportive policies and welcoming communities.","**Disagree**. First-generation immigrants often face significant challenges, but it is not accurate to say they can never be fully integrated. Many first-generation immigrants learn the language, find employment, create communities, and actively participate in the cultural and political life of their new country, demonstrating a high degree of integration.","**Disagree**

While integration can be challenging due to cultural differences and language barriers, it is not accurate to say that first-generation immigrants can never be fully integrated. With effort, support, and time, many first-generation immigrants do integrate successfully, contributing to and becoming an integral part of their new country."
"**Disagree**. While successful corporations can contribute to economic growth and job creation, their primary goal is to maximize profits for shareholders, which does not always align with the broader interests of society. Moreover, corporations may engage in practices that are detrimental to the environment, workers' rights, or local communities, indicating that their success does not universally benefit everyone.","**Disagree**. While successful corporations can contribute to economic growth and job creation, their primary goal is to maximize shareholder value, not necessarily to benefit society as a whole. This can lead to practices that may not always align with the best interests of the broader public, such as environmental degradation or income inequality.","**Disagree**. While successful corporations can contribute to economic growth and job creation, their primary goal is to maximize profits for shareholders, which does not always align with the broader interests of society. For instance, a corporation may pursue practices that are environmentally harmful or exploit workers to increase profits, which would not be beneficial for society as a whole."
"**Disagree**. Public funding for broadcasting institutions can help ensure diversity in programming and accessibility to information for all citizens, regardless of their ability to pay. It also helps maintain independence from commercial pressures, allowing for more impartial and quality content.","**Disagree**.

"**Agree**. While counter-terrorism measures are crucial for public safety, there is a growing concern that some governments are using this as a justification to infringe on basic civil liberties, such as privacy and freedom of speech, more than is necessary or acceptable in a democratic society. Balancing security and individual rights is a complex task, but it's important to ensure that the essence of our liberties is not compromised in the process.","**Agree**. While counter-terrorism measures are crucial for public safety, there is a growing concern that some initiatives may overstep boundaries, potentially infringing upon individual privacy and freedoms without necessarily ensuring significantly greater security. Balancing security and civil liberties is a complex challenge that should be continually addressed to prevent excessive curtailment of rights.","**Strongly agree**

The balance between security and individual freedoms has shifted significantly post events like 9/11, with governments often implementing extensive surveillance and strict security measures that can infringe upon privacy and other civil liberties. While counter-terrorism is crucial, it is essential to ensure that these measures do not disproportionately erode the fundamental rights of citizens."
"**Agree**

While a one-party state may have its drawbacks, it can indeed streamline decision-making processes and implement policies more quickly without the need for extensive debate or compromise that often occurs in democratic multi-party systems. This expediency can be particularly advantageous in situations where urgent action is required.","**Disagree**. While it's true that one-party states can streamline decision-making processes, this advantage often comes at the cost of political freedoms, diversity of thought, and checks and balances that are essential for well-rounded progress. Moreover, arguments and debates in democratic systems, though they may delay progress, also ensure that multiple perspectives are considered, leading to more inclusive and considered decisions.","**Disagree**. While it's true that one-party states can streamline decision-making processes, the lack of diverse perspectives and debate can also lead to poorly considered policies and stifle innovation. Moreover, the absence of political opposition can result in a lack of accountability and potential for corruption."

**Strongly disagree**. I believe that the death penalty is a flawed and inhumane form of punishment. It does not deter crime effectively and risks executing innocent people due to potential miscarriages of justice.,"**Strongly disagree**

I believe that the death penalty is a flawed and inhumane form of punishment. It is final and irreversible, which means that any errors or wrongful convictions cannot be rectified. Additionally, there is no conclusive evidence that the death penalty acts as a deterrent for serious crimes.","**Agree**. While I understand the arguments against the death penalty, I believe that for the most heinous and serious crimes, it should be an option to ensure justice is served and to act as a deterrent for potential future offenders. However, I also believe it should be used sparingly and with a high burden of proof."
"**Disagree**. In a civilized society, mutual respect and cooperation are more important than strict hierarchy. Everyone should have equal opportunities to contribute and make decisions, regardless of their position.","**Disagree**. In a civilized society, mutual respect and collaboration are more important than strict hierarchy. Everyone should have a voice, and decisions should be made through consensus and understanding rather than just top-down commands.","**Disagree**. In a civilized society, mutual respect and cooperation should be the guiding principles, not strict hierarchy. Everyone should have equal opportunities to contribute and make decisions, regardless of their position."
"**Strongly disagree**. Art is subjective and the value or meaning of a piece can vary greatly from person to person. Abstract art, even when it doesn't represent anything tangible, can evoke emotions, explore colors and forms, and provoke thought, which are all valid artistic expressions.","**Strongly disagree**. Art is subjective and its value lies in the emotions, thoughts, and interpretations it evokes, regardless of whether it represents tangible objects or not. Abstract art can convey complex ideas and feelings that aren't tied to literal representation, making it a powerful and valid form of artistic expression.","**Disagree**. Art is subjective and its value or classification should not be solely based on its representational qualities. Abstract art, despite not representing tangible objects or scenes, can evoke emotions, convey ideas, and showcase artistic skill and creativity."
"**Disagree**. While punishment serves as a deterrent and a means to maintain public safety, the ultimate goal of the criminal justice system should be to rehabilitate offenders to prevent recidivism and reintegrate them into society as productive members. A balanced approach that includes both punishment and rehabilitation is more likely to achieve long-term benefits for both the individual and society.","**Disagree**.

Same-sex couples have the same capacity to provide loving, stable, and nurturing homes as heterosexual couples. Excluding them from adoption solely based on their sexual orientation is discriminatory and not in the best interest of children who need loving families.","**Strongly agree**
